- unordered_map<int, vector<int>>
  key -> time
  value -> list of thread numbers associated with time

- calc std deviation
  - if any values >= mean + k * stddev (k is arbitrary, define a default for now) then we'll consider that load imbalance

- output to hdf5

- allow for slices in the device - arbitrary dynamic memory. need a gpu vector or something that can push slices of thread times,
multiple times for a single kernel invocation
